                In a world that wants you to be just one thing, <strong>be everything</strong>.

                I'm a writer, researcher, and community builder. My brain doesn't just stick to one lane—it builds
                highways between them.
                Whether I'm dissecting history as an Asian Studies major, crafting creative non-fiction on
                <em>Inquisitive Penelope</em>, or
                navigating the chaotic future of AI, I'm always looking for the story underneath the surface.

            <h2>Tip #102: Why "Inquisitive"?</h2>
            <p>
                I write to understand. My blog, <strong>Inquisitive Penelope</strong>, is where I turn raw observation
                into narrative.
                I believe that personal essays and creative storytelling are the best tools we have to make sense of a
                world that
                increasingly feels like it's glitching.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not just looking for a job; I'm looking for a place where my curiosity is an asset, not a
                distraction.
